TODO needed to merge with dev.

FIX:
RemoteMiners and RemoteHaulers - traveling action paths to flag rather than sources/containers. This causes the internal pathfinding to fail when roads exist in previous rooms. The creep will hop between rooms saying "NO PATH!" until it dies. Started to add in a fix which caches sources in memory and gives remoteMiner travel action a source position when it spawns.
RemoteHaulers - find and fix line 69, getting following error. only happens sometimes. creep is still alive, spawningTime is written to memory.

IMPROVE:
RemoteHaulers - improve spawn queue placement. ie. when no haulers exist place in medium queue, when some exist place in low.
RemoteHaulers - improve CARRY needed to haul a source. The calculation of CARRY pieces for distance.

ADD:
claimers - Task out claimers.
remoteBuilders - Create remoteBuilder task and make them roam through rooms around a spawn repairing roads on swamps, repairing containers to almost max, and building roads on swamps for claimers and remoteHaulers.

IMPLEMENT:
Source Creeper killers - merge and combine features with other branches in repo.
